# HomeValue-Predictor-A-Linear-Regression-Approach.
HomeValue Predictor: A Linear Regression Approach leverages linear regression to estimate house prices based on features like area, location, and number of rooms. This project aims to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions with accurate, data-driven price predictions.

Overview of the House Price Prediction Model
📊 1. Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location preferences, and furnishing status using a Linear Regression model.

📝 2. Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains various features affecting house prices, including:
Numerical Features: Area (in sq. ft), Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories
Categorical Features: Main Road Access, Guest Room, Basement, Hot Water Heating, Air Conditioning, Preferred Area, Furnishing Status
Target Variable: Price of the house

⚙️ 3. Data Preprocessing:
Handling Categorical Data:
Used Label Encoding to convert categories into numeric values.
Feature Selection:
Dropped irrelevant features and kept those significantly influencing house prices.

🧮 4. Model Selection & Training:
Chose Linear Regression for its simplicity and interpretability.
Split data into:
80% Training Set
20% Testing Set
Trained the model to find the best-fit line minimizing the error between actual and predicted prices.

📈 5. Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Easier interpretation in terms of price units.
R-squared (R²): Indicates how well the model explains variance in prices.
